## Installation

To install and set up the News API, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub by running the following command in your terminal:

   
   git clone https://github.com/nbdev-sl/AdaDerana-News-API.git
   

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   
   npm install cheerio axios express
   

## Usage

Once you have successfully installed the News API, you can start using it to retrieve the latest news articles. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Import the necessary modules in your project:

   javascript
   const axios = require('axios');
   const cheerio = require('cheerio');
   const express = require('express');
   

2. Create an instance of the Express application:

   javascript
   const app = express();
   

3. Define the route for retrieving news articles:

   javascript
   app.get('/news', async (req, res) => {
     // Your code to fetch news articles here
   });
   

4. Within the route handler, use Axios to make a request to the desired news source and retrieve the HTML content:

   javascript
   const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/news');
   

5. Use Cheerio to parse the HTML content and extract the relevant information:

   javascript
   const $ = cheerio.load(response.data);
   // Your code to extract news articles here
   

6. Format the extracted information into a desired response format (e.g., JSON) and send it back as the API response:

   javascript
   res.json(newsArticles);
   

7. Start the Express server to listen for incoming requests:

   javascript
   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('News API server is running on port 3000');
   });
   

That's it! You have successfully installed and set up the News API. You can now customize the code to fetch news articles from your desired sources and define additional routes as needed.
